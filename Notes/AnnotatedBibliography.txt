* Reillly and Goodman, 1985. Quantitative analysis of Saltwater - freshwater relationships in groundwater systems - a historical perspective. 
   * Hubbert - related freshwater head, saltwater head to position of water interface
      * improved previous Ghyben-Herzberg principle
   * z = density freshwater / (density freshwater - density saltwater) * H
   * z == 40h w/ simplifaction
   * assumptions of models
      * 3D analysis of systems often contains many assumptions, i.e. a sharp interface, density distribution
      * many models ignore the influence of wells and resulting upconing
   * critical pumping rate: the deepest place a well cone remains stable (no saltwater intrusion in the longterm into the well)
* Applied Hydrology textbook
   * vadose zone (zone of aereation): a soil region which contains air and water
   * water table (zone of saturation), even deeper is magmatic water
   * currents caused by differences in temperature, salinity. Ex, above 38 lat, net heat loss, but below 38 lat, net head gain
* Moore, Willard. 2009. The Effect of Submarine Groundwater Discharge on the Ocean.
   * Submarine grondwater discharge (SGD): a source of nutrients, carbon, metals to coastal waters
      * included in ocean budget; can exceed fluxes to rivers
      * lags between freshwater recharge and discharge
   * measured using: thermal imaging (Groundwater temp), radium, electro.

   * Seawater intrusion (SI) influenced by pumping, sea-level fluctuations, land-use changes, coastal groundwater changes
   * “Henry Problem”: an idealized seawater intrusion problem
   * mixing zones: high variability and mobility
      * range from meters to kilometers
      * change based on seasonal variations
   * scale of heterogenities important due to preferential flow paths
   * wells can change mixing zone thickness
   * surface water injections at toe penetration are most effective
* Smith, Anthony (2003). Mixed convection and density-dependent seawater circulation in coastal aquifers
   * A highly technical paper that also focuses on SGD
   * * Fresh and saline groundwater discharge to the ocean: A regional perspective
   * Describes the effects of topography driven flow, coastal seawater recirculation, geothermal convection
      * creates a conceptual model for long-term SGD with large 10-100’s km scale
      * places coastal fow in regional context, fresh and saline part in SGD
      * a good resource for modeling and testing numerical models
   * analyzes how geothermal convection, seawater convection drive the SGD which is driven by density gradients
   * determines whether regional flow is significant -- older water
   * numerical stimulations
      * coastal plane geometry more important than continental slope
      * found that long time scales required for deep areas of mixing zone
   * total flux increased slightly with an intcrease in dispersivity, horizonal width mixing zone decreased with smaller dispersivity
