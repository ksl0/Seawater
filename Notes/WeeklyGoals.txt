Week 1: 06/22/2014
* Create matlab script to change BTN data: https://gist.github.com/ksl0/dcfc87bf7289087c3134 
   * visualize output with model viewer to check orientation
   * write tests to guarantee functionality of the code
* Complete annotated bibliography for the 5 papers emailed,[a] and an additional 3 other papers 
* Read through chapters 3,5 (maybe 7) in Applied Hydrogeology
* Create discretizations: 250 x 1.5m, 125 x 3m, and 125 x 1.5m on Argus One
* Other: set up remote desktop connection




Week 2: 06/29/2015
* Find the optimum discretization
   * Finish discretizations from ArgusONE
   * Using matlab, revise the btn files with closer saltwater concentrations
   * Run Kaileight’s code,  maybe mflab, rewrite lpf files for each realization
* Gain deeper understanding of seawater intrusion, through modeling, other two texts, more papers
* Start on project to determine the effect of dispersivity on homogenous v. heterogenous systems
