%%The following values will be output to the matrix called Results:
    %Column 1:  Connectivity case number (set_num)
    %Column 2:  Run number (p)
    %Column 3:  Total mass flow entering prescribed head boundaries to check against list file, kg/s (Sum_Hm_in)
    %Column 4:  Total mass flow exiting prescribed head boundareis to check against list file, kg/s (Sum_Hm_in)
    %Column 5:  Fresh recharge entering model, m^3/s (Recharge_fresh)
    %Column 6:  Fresh SGD exiting model, m^3/s (SGD_fresh)
    %Column 7:  Saline circulation entering model, m^3/s (Circulation_saline)
    %Column 8:  Saline SGD exiting model, m^3/s (SGD_saline)
    %Column 9:  Total increase in model mass flow storage to check against list file, kg/s (Storage_gain)
    %Column 10: Total decrease in model mass flow storage to check against list file, kg/s (Storage_loss)
    %Column 11: Total increase in DCDT (DCDT_inc)<---Still figuring this out
    %Column 12: Total decrease in DCDT (DCDT_dec)<---Still figuring this out
    %Column 13: Area of interface between 10% and 90% saline, m^2 (interface_area)
    %Column 14: Length of interface between 10% and 90% saline at model top, m (interface_top)
    %Column 15: Length of interface between 10% and 90% saline at model bottom, m (interface_bottom)
    %Column 16: Wedge center of mass y coordinate, m (Cy)
    %Column 17: Wedge center of mass z coordinate, m (Cz)
    %Column 18: Minimum concentration check, ppt (C)
    %Column 19: Maximum concentration check, ppt (C)
    %Column 20: Maximum Peclet number, y direction (Peclet_y)
    %Column 21: Maximum Peclet number, z direction (Peclet_z)
